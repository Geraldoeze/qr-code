### What I learned

In the process of building this web page, i learnt how to use flex to position the display to the center.

```html
   <div class="qr-container">...</div>
```
```css
.qr-container {
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    height: 100vh;
    background-color:  hsl(217, 81%, 90%);
    justify-content: center;
}
```

### Continued development

Flexbox is a major area I plan on improving on, as well as responsive designs.

### Useful resources

- [Google font](https://fonts.google.com) - This helped me when working on the fonts for my page.
